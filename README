Jenkins RunDeck plugin

This plugin is a Jenkins Notifier (Publisher) that will talk to a RunDeck instance (via its HTTP API) to schedule a job execution on RunDeck after a successful build on Jenkins.

We use it to do a 0-click deployment : from commit to deploy, automatically. Jenkins build the project, and RunDeck deploys it. This plugin does the link between these 2 tools.

<div>
    Used to perform "on-demand" job scheduling on RunDeck : if the value is not empty,
    we will check if the SCM changelog contains the given tag, and only schedule a job execution
    if it is present. For example you can set the value to "<strong>#deploy</strong>".
    Note that if this value is left empty, we will ALWAYS schedule a job execution.
